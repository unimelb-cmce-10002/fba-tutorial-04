## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

* Calculate and interpret key financial metrics – Use `mutate()` to create measures such as profit margin, asset turnover, and ROIC, and explain what these reveal about a firm’s strategic approach.  
* Visualise variable distributions – Use `ggplot2` to produce and interpret histograms for financial ratios, identify issues such as outliers, and explain how data pruning affects interpretation.  
* Explore relationships between firm strategy variables – Create scatterplots to examine how profit margin and asset turnover interact, and classify firms into strategy types (e.g., high margin, high volume, superstar, sinking ship).  
* Identify and profile firms at distribution extremes – Use `filter()`, `arrange()`, `select()`, and `slice_max()` to locate firms with exceptional margins, volumes, or profitability, and interpret these outliers in context.  
* Analyse strategy by grouping variables – Apply `group_by()` and `summarise()` to compare strategy types across industries, firm sizes, and profitability tiers.  
* Present comparative visualisations – Use faceted scatterplots, size/colour encodings, and stacked bar charts to reveal variation in firm strategy across sectors and performance categories.
